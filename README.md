## Features

- **Extensive Exercise Database:** The Gym Exercise Library provides over 1000 exercises for users to explore and incorporate into their fitness routines.
- **Responsive User Interface:** I have designed and developed a responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and React.js with the MUI framework. This ensures that the application adapts well to different screen sizes and provides an optimal experience across devices.
- **Integration with ExerciseDB API:** The application seamlessly integrates with the ExerciseDB API to fetch exercise details and display them to the users. This ensures that the exercise library stays up to date and provides accurate information.
- **React Router Implementation:** To ensure smooth navigation and provide step-by-step instructions, I have implemented React Router. This allows users to easily browse through exercises, view detailed information, and watch demo videos.
- **User-Friendly Website:** The project prioritizes user experience by adhering to project requirements, making it easy for users to find exercises, access relevant information, and follow instructions effectively.
